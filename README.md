ZG61_JSSAPUI5_day6_Assignment 
Assignment for the week.
In the same template that we have shared.
In Main Screen (Create 5 fields)
• First name -> INput
• last name -> Input
• email id -> Input
• Designation -> Combobox (values should come from json Model)
• Doj -> Date picker

Create a table below in main screen having those 5 fields.
Type of table should have navigation property, that we did yesterday.
As soon as you click on any of the record in your table, it should navigate to next view detail screen and
should display the data of selected row.(above 5 fields)

The data in the table will be pushed from above 5 minutes, what we mean, as soon as the user
enters the detail in the above 5 fields in main screen, there will be an add button, once you click
on add button a new record should be created in table, and as the record is available it should
navigate to next screen and populate the data.
